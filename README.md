# Intro.To.Programming.Object.Oriented.Lab
Assigned lab teaching and explaining the ins and outs of object-oriented learning. Created in PyCharm in Python.

This was the second to last assignment my professor had given us to code. Overall, her class was phenomenal; I had no issues learning Python at all! She provided two chunks of the code for us to work into the main method, as well as instructions in the word document I have uploaded earlier.

I am proud of the work I have submitted in class. Whole-heartedly, I can say I enjoy coding (as frustating as it can be at times) and can't wait to produce more complex programs!
